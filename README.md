## Branching Strategy

This project follows the GitHub Flow branching model.

- The `main` branch always contains stable, production-ready code.
- New features are developed in separate feature branches.
- Each feature branch is created from `main` and merged back after testing.
- This ensures clean version control and safe feature integration.
